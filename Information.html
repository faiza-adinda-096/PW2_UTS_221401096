    </div>
    <hr class="border border-danger border-2 opacity-40">
    <ol class="role">
        <h2><li>Initiator</h2>
            <p>Initiators challenge angles by setting up their team to enter contested ground and push defenders away.</p>
            <ul class="initiator">
                <li>Breach</li>
                <p>Breach uses seismic energy to disorient his opponents with blinding charges, and can create quakes that resonate across the entire map and dazes all who are caught in its waves.</p>
                <li>Fade</li>
                <p>Fade uses terror to her advantage, marking enemies with a dark mist that tracks them. Her Prowler can nearsight enemies that it touches, her knot can hold enemies in place and deafen them, and she can emit a wave of nightmare energy that decays any foe that it touches.</p>
                <li>KAY/O</li>
                <p>A robotic powerhouse, KAY/O can throw powerful flash and explosive grenades, as well as a suppression blade with a delayed explosive timer. His Ultimate enables him to overload with energy, and emit pulses in a radius that surpresses enemies caught in its waves.</p>
                <li>Skye</li>
                <p>Skye uses her various trinkets to trigger various effects, summoning Seekers, a hawk, and a Tasmanian tiger to deal drastic damage to a targeted enemy. But she can also use healing trinkets to heal those around her, with the exception of herself.</p>
                <li>Sova</li>
                <p>A technologically advanced hunter, Sova uses his owl drone to tag enemies across the map, and he uses his bow to fire various bolts that can apply various effects, from shock and recon, to wall-piercing energy blasts.</p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
                <h2><li>Duelist</h2>
                    <p>Duelists are self-sufficient fraggers who their team expects, through abilities and skills, to get high frags and seek out engagements first.</p>
                    <ul class="duelist">
                        <li>Jett</li>
                        <p>Jett uses her mastery of the air and winds to glide around the battlefield and get the drop on her opponents from above. Her daggers can sail through the air at incredible speeds, and they rarely miss their target.</p>
                        <li>Neon</li>
                        <p>Neon uses the power of electricity to blind opponents with walls of light, and enhances her own power and speed with deadly lightning beams. Her spark can turn the tide of a fight, regardless of the odds.</p>
                        <li>Phoenix</li>
                        <p>Phoenix, like his namesake, is all about fire, and rising from the ashes. With the ability to create walls of fire, throw fireballs, and resurrect at a designated location with full health upon death, Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
                        <li>Raze</li>
                        <p>Raze is another appropriately named Agent, as pretty much everything in her wake is rubble. Using Boom Bots, Blast Packs, Cluster Grenades, and a rocket launcher, Raze will destroy anything and everything in her path.</p>
                        <li>Reyna</li>
                        <p>Reyna has access to dark ethereal abilities that create Soul Orbs upon downing an enemy. She can consume them to heal and become briefly invulnerable. Using Empress, her firing, equip and reload speeds all receive a dramatic boost, making her a powerhouse in battle.</p>
                        <li>Yoru</li>
                        <p>Yoru has the ability to create rifts in reality, and create mirror images of himself, or even become entirely invisible to the enemy for a brief time. This level of espionage makes him a potent weapon in any scenario.</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <h2><li>Controller</h2>
                    <p>Controllers are experts in slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success.</p>
                    <ul class="controller">
                        <li>Astra</li>
                        <p>Astra has the power to call on the cosmic forces of the universe, and activate stars on the battlefield that have a number of different effects to choose from. Versatile, and more importantly, deadly, astrology and the zodiacs have never seemed more terrifying.</p>
                        <li>Brimstone</li>
                        <p>Using payload technology, brimstone brings the fire by using his grenade launcher, smoke clouds, and orbital strike laser to bombard the enemy with relentless and deadly armaments.</p>
                        <li>Harbor</li>
                        <p>An Agent with complete control of the ocean, Harbor can use the waves to create defensive spheres or walls of water to protect or block who he wishes. He can also summon geysers of high powered water from the ground that can easily disorient, or even wash away opponents completely.</p>
                        <li>Omen</li>
                        <p>Omen has control over various orbs that completely block an opponent's vision, giving Omen the immediate upper hand in a firefight. He can also enter an ethereal form to teleport around the map.</p>
                        <li>Viper</li>
                        <p>Viper is much like the animal she takes her name from, using toxins and poison to disorient and eliminate her foes. With huge AOE/CC potential, Viper is a formidable opponent to those trying to seize an area of the map from her.</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <h2><li>Sentinel</h2>
                    <p>Sentinels are defensive experts who can lock down areas and watch flanks, both on attacker and defender rounds.</p>
                    <ul class="sentinel">
                        <li>Chamber</li>
                        <p>Chamber is an excellent all-rounder. With the ability to place scanning traps, summon a heavy pistol, create a teleportation anchor, and the deadliest sniper rifle in the game, Chamber is an Agent you can rely on to keep the enemy on their toes.</p>
                        <li>Cypher</li>
                        <p>A master of espionage, Cypher can place trapwires and cages across the map to ensnare unsuspecting opponents. His darts and spycams let him survey the battlefield better than most others, and can even scan for living enemies through the corpses of those he's slain.</p>
                        <li>Killjoy</li>
                        <p>KIlljoy lives up to her name when it comes to how the enemies will feel. Her Nanoswarm and Alarmbots can distract and debuff enemies unfortunately enough to encounter them, whilst her turret and lockdown device enables her to effectively close off certain lanes.</p>
                        <li>Sage</li>
                        <p>A potent medic on the battlefield, Sage can fire Healing Orbs at damaged allies, whilst slowing enemies with barriers and AOE slowing fields. Her Ultimate enables a full res for one of her allies, making her an invaluable asset to any team.</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
               </ol>
